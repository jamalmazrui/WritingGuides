<h1 style='margin-right:.05pt'><a name="_Toc29906">Foreword to the First
Edition</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The link between courts and the
public is the written word. With rare exceptions, it is through judicial
opinions that courts communicate with litigants, lawyers, other courts, and the
community. Whatever the court’s statutory and constitutional status, the
written word, in the end, is the source and the measure of the court’s
authority. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> It is therefore not enough that
a decision be correct—it must also be fair and reasonable and readily
understood. The burden of the judicial opinion is to explain and to persuade
and to satisfy the world that the decision is principled and sound. What the
court says, and how it says it, is as important as what the court decides. It
is important to the reader. But it is also important to the author because in
the writing lies the test of the thinking that underlies it. “Good writing,”
Ambrose Bierce said, “essentially is clear thinking made visible.” Ambrose
Bierce, Write It Right 6 (rev. ed. 1986). </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> To serve the cause of good
opinion writing, the Federal Judicial Center has prepared this manual. It is
not held out as an authoritative pronouncement on good writing, a subject on
which the literature abounds. Rather, it distills the experience and reflects
the views of a group of experienced judges, vetted by a distinguished board of
editors. No one of them would approach the task of writing an opinion, or
describe the process, precisely as any of the others would. Yet, though this is
a highly personal endeavor, some generally accepted principles of good opinion
writing emerge and they are the subject of this manual. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> We hope that judges and their
law clerks will find this manual helpful and that it will advance the cause for
which it has been prepared.</p>

<h1 style='margin-right:0in'><a name="_Toc29907">Foreword to the Second Edition</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>More than twenty years have
passed since the Federal Judicial Center published the first edition of this
manual on judicial writing. In that relatively brief time, many of our basic
assumptions about written communication have been challenged profoundly by
technological change. Like books, magazines, and newspapers, orders and
opinions written by judges are more likely than not to take the form of digital
images rather than tangible objects.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Indeed, with so much of today’s
writing embedded in the truncated protocols of social media and other “real
time” forms of expression, the clarity and persuasive quality the authors of
the first edition sought to teach are particularly important for judges’
writing. But the elements of good writing are remarkably constant, and we think
that you will find the principles explained so thoughtfully in the first
edition no less applicable today.</p>

<h1 style='margin-right:.05pt'><a name="_Toc29908">I. Introduction</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Judicial opinions serve three
functions. First, written opinions communicate a court’s conclusions and the
reasons for them to the parties and their lawyers. Second, when published,
opinions announce the law to judges, academics, other lawyers, and the interested
public. Finally, the preparation of a written opinion imposes intellectual
discipline on the author, requiring the judge to clarify his or her reasoning
and assess the sufficiency of precedential support for it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> The opinion should fairly,
clearly, and accurately state the significant facts and relevant rules of law
and demonstrate by its analysis the reasonableness of its conclusions.
Misstating significant facts or authorities is a mark of carelessness, and it
undermines the opinion’s authority and integrity. Unclear or ambiguous writing
reflects the author’s lack of clear thinking and defeats the opinion’s purpose.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> This manual is intended to
encourage judges and law clerks to think critically about their writing—not
only about what to include and what to exclude, but also about how to write
well. We expect that newly appointed judges and their law clerks will be the
principal users of this manual. It therefore takes a functional approach to
opinion writing: describing the considerations that arise at each stage of the
writing and editing process; recommending organizational and stylistic
techniques; and explaining the reasons for its recommendations. In keeping with
the principle that there is no single right way to write an opinion, the manual
explores alternatives and the considerations for choosing among them. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> This manual should also help experienced judges take a
fresh look at their approaches to writing and their styles. Professor Robert
Leflar wrote: </p>

pride can drive a man to hard work and with meticulous effort. The poorest
opinions are apt to be written by judges who take no pride in them, who regard
the preparation of them as mere chores. Pride in work well done is a proper
incident of good craftsmanship in any field of work, including law. An opinion
in which the author takes no pride is not likely to be much good.</span><a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:1.25pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> This manual is not intended to proclaim the right way of
writ ing an opinion. Anyone who attempts to announce authoritative rules of
good writing invites debate and comparison. As one judge said, “I have one
overarching rule. That is, don’t have any such rules.” Indeed, in a leading
text on good writing, E. B. White acknowledged that “[s]tyle rules of this sort
are, of course, somewhat a matter of individual preference, and even the
established rules of grammar are open to challenge.”<a href="#_ftn2"

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Instead, the purpose of the
manual is to stimulate judges to think as systematically about writing their
opinions as they do about deciding their cases. Judges should ask themselves:
Am I writing this way because this is how I’ve always done it, or is there a
better way? Is there a reason for organizing the opinion this way? For
including these particular facts? For discussing this issue at length? For
citing this case? Is this sentence clear? Are all the words in it necessary? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> In the following parts, the
manual takes readers through the opinion-writing process. Part 2 suggests
issues to consider in deciding whether to write a formal opinion, a memorandum,
or an unpublished opinion. Part 3 discusses steps a judge should take before
starting to write. Part 4 discusses the organization and content of an opinion.
Part 5 offers suggestions on language, style, and editing. Part 6 presents
considerations for cowriting an opinion, commenting on the opinions of other
members of the court, and writing dissenting and concurring opinions. Part 7
contains a list of books and articles that may be useful to those who want to
read more about judicial writing. The appendices provide examples of some of
the writings discussed in the manual, such as summary orders and dissenting
opinions.</p>

<h1 style='margin-right:.05pt'><a name="_Toc29909">II. Determining the Scope of
the Opinion</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>A judicial opinion informs parties of the outcome of their
case and articulates the legal principles on which the decision is based in
order to guide the bench, the bar, academia, and the public. Because written
decisions serve both case-deciding and law-making functions, they range in form
from one-sentence, unpublished summary orders to formally structured,
citation-laden, full-dress opinions. An opinion that is intended only to inform
the parties of the outcome of their dispute should not be as elaborate as one
intended to serve as a precedent. Before beginning to write, judges should
decide what purpose the opinion will serve and how to write it to suit that
purpose. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29910">Three types of decisions</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>This manual will refer to three
types of written decisions: full-dress opinions, memorandum opinions, and
summary orders. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Full-dress opinions are those
that present a structured discussion of the facts, legal principles, and
governing authorities involved in a case. The significance or number of the
issues presented in a case, the novelty of the question it poses, and the
complexity of the facts are among the factors that determine whether an opinion
requires fulldress treatment. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Memorandum opinions are
appropriate if the decision does not require a comprehensive, structured
explanation but still needs some explanation of the rationale. They are
generally brief and informal and may or may not be published. Per curiam
opinions are generally included in this category. Appendix A contains an
example of a memorandum opinion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Summary orders simply state the disposition of the case.
They sometimes include a brief statement of findings and conclusions, but often
provide little or no explanation. Summary orders are usually unpublished.
Appendix B contains an example of a summary order.  The next section discusses
some of the factors a judge should consider in determining what kind of opinion
to write. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29911">Factors to consider </a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Three factors influence the scope and style of an opinion:
the complexity of the facts and nature of the legal issues, the intended
audience, and whether the opinion will be published. Although the manu al
addresses these factors separately, they are interrelated. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29912">Facts and issues </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The complexity of the facts and
the nature of the legal issues are the principal factors that determine the
kind of opinion required. If the precedents are clear and the material facts
are not complicated, the scope of the opinion will be limited. If the
controlling law is uncertain or the material facts are complex, exposition and
analysis are needed to explain the reasons for the court’s decision. Some cases
that present complex fact patterns may require lengthy discussion of the facts
even though the applicable law may be simple. Other cases that raise novel
legal issues may require extended analysis of law and policy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> The scope of an opinion will be
influenced by how well developed the law is on the matter at issue. Judges
should consider whether the issue has previously been decided authoritatively
and whether another opinion would aid in the development or explanation of the
law. If the issue has been thoroughly discussed in prior opinions, the judge
need not trace the origins of the law or elaborate on its interpretation. In
some cases, it is sufficient to affirm a decision for the reasons stated by the
court below. If the decision merely closes a gap in existing law, little more
is needed than an explanation of the applicable principles and the reasons for
the court’s choice among them. If, however, the decision contributes to the
development of the law, a brief, published per curiam or memorandum opinion is
appropriate. A summary order may be sufficient if clear existing law is simply
being applied to facts that are undisputed or that are made indisputable on
appeal because, for example, they are jury findings supported by substantial
evidence. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> When, however, an opinion involves less developed areas of
the law and lays down a new rule or modifies an old one, the judge must think
not only about the decision’s rationale but also about its impact as precedent.
The judge should discuss and analyze the precedents in the area, the new
direction the law is taking, and the effect of the decision on existing law.
Even if it appears that the litigants do not need a detailed statement of the
facts, the opinion should present sufficient facts to define for other readers
the precedent it creates and to delineate its boundaries. The relevant
precedents—and the relevant policies—should be analyzed in sufficient detail to
establish the rationale for the holding. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29913">Audience </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Opinions are written primarily
for the litigants and their lawyers, and for the lower courts or agencies whose
decisions they review. If an opinion is addressed to the parties, it should
provide them with a fair and accurate statement of what was before the court
for decision, what the court decided, and what the reasons for the decision
were. This can generally be accomplished without a full-dress opinion. The
parties will be familiar with the facts and will generally not be interested in
an extensive exploration of the law, other than what is needed to give the
losing party a clear explanation for the result. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> The judge must also ask whether
the opinion has something to say to others besides the parties. Opinions
intended to inform other audiences may require additional factual development
and legal analysis. How much analysis is required, and how detailed it must be,
depends on the subject matter and the probable audience. Judges may assume a
certain level of familiarity with the law on the part of lawyers. But if a case
involves an arcane area of law familiar primarily to specialists— tax, labor,
or antitrust law, for example—a thorough discussion of the facts and legal
background will be needed, and the judge should avoid the use of technical
language and should define any technical terms that must be used. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> An opinion remanding a case must
tell the lower court what is expected on remand. An opinion that sets
guidelines for trial courts to follow must state the factual basis, legal
rationale, and policy foundation of the guidelines sufficiently so that trial
judges can apply them correctly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> The judge needs to consider
whether a statement of facts and legal analysis that adequately explain the
decision to the parties will also enable a higher court to understand the basis
for the decision. When the decision is based on complex facts, a more elaborate
explanation than is necessary for the parties may be helpful to the appellate
court. And when the decision involves novel issues or an emerging area of law, it
is appropriate to trace the prior development of the law and to explain the
legal and policy rationales at some length. Opinions should not, however, be
turned into briefs or vehicles for advocacy. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Members of the general public will rarely read opinions.
But re porters from the media will communicate what they believe to be the
substance of an opinion that strikes them as being of public interest. When an
opinion addresses an issue of general public interest or is likely to attract
media attention, it should be written in a manner that will ensure it cannot be
misunderstood. The mark of a well-written opinion is that it is comprehensible
to an intelligent layperson. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.75pt;

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Other circuits have more general
guidelines, giving judges latitude to decide whether to publish opinions. The
Third Circuit, for example, has “two forms of opinions: precedential and not

The Second Circuit permits disposition by summary order “[w]hen a decision in a
case is unanimous and each panel judge believes that no jurisprudential purpose
is served by an opinion . . . .”<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'><sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:104%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:#181717'>[4]</span></sup></span></sup></a>

font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:#181717'>[5]</span></sup></span></sup></a> 
In the district courts, the decision to publish is entirely in the judge’s
discretion. (Note, however, that some legal publishers, including Westlaw, put
certain district court orders and opinions on line whether or not the judge
designates them for publication and even sometimes when a judge states that the
order or opinion is “not for publication” or “not to be cited.” The publishers
base their decision on whether they think that the order or opinion is
significant or otherwise of interest.) Because decisions of district judges are
merely persuasive authority—that is, they are not binding precedent even in
their own districts—publication of such decisions should be the exception. In
addition, time constraints argue against writing formal opinions unless the
decision involves a novel or complex issue or a matter of public importance and
thus may be useful to attorneys and judges or be of interest to the public. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Because unpublished decisions
are written primarily for the parties, they will require little or no
elaboration of the facts and law. Often they will take the form of summary
orders or memorandum opinions. The determination as to whether a disposition
should be published or unpublished should be made as soon as possible, so that
the judge who writes the opinion will not spend an undue amount of time on it
if publication is not warranted. </p>

Opinion</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Before beginning to write an
opinion, judges should think through what they want to say and how they want to
say it. They should consider the scope of the opinion, the prospective
audience, and whether the opinion will be published. They should marshal the
material facts, identify the issues and the applicable rules of law, and
determine the appropriate form of judicial relief. In short, they must break
the case down into its components. A judge should have reached a decision— if
only a tentative one—before beginning to write an opinion. Setting down the
reasons in writing then constitutes the process of justifying the decision. As
Judge Ruggero Aldisert wrote, “If a judge wants to write clearly and cogently,
with words parading before the reader in logical order, the judge must first
think clearly and cogently, with thoughts laid out in neat rows.”<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:6.65pt;
margin-left:-.25pt;line-height:105%'> This does not mean that judges will not
change their minds after they have started to write. Sometimes judges may
decide in advance where they want to go, but in the process of writing discover
that they cannot get there. Justice Roger Traynor wrote that he <span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:105%'>found [no] better test for the
solution of a case than its articulation in writing, which is thinking at its
hardest. A judge, inevitably preoccupied with the far-reaching effect of an
immediate solution as a precedent, often discovers that his tentative views
will not jell in the writing. He wrestles with the devil more than once to set
forth a sound opinion that will be sufficient unto more than the day.</span><a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Nevertheless, the writing should reflect only the final
decision and the reasons for it. If the decision is a close one, the opinion
should say so, but it should not record every step and misstep the writer took
along the way. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29916">Developing outlines </a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Outlines help to organize a
writer’s thoughts. For judicial writing, they may take a variety of forms: </p>

</span>perhaps only an unwritten mental framework. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Whatever the outline’s form, the
point is that judges, like all other good writers, must organize their thoughts
before starting to write. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> A good time to prepare an outline is shortly after the
conference at which the case is discussed and the opinion assigned, when the
judge’s own ideas and those of the other judges are fresh in mind. The outline
can then also serve as an informal record of the discussion at the conference. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29917">Using law clerks </a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Law clerks can provide
substantial assistance to the judge faced with writing an opinion. Discussions
with law clerks are helpful in planning the opinion and developing the outline.
The opportunity to test one’s thoughts in vigorous exchanges with the clerks
throughout the opinion-writing process is invaluable. The judge and the law
clerks can discuss and criticize the opinion as it develops, ferret out error
and ambiguity, and polish the final product. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> In the writing process itself,
judges use their law clerks in different ways. Some limit the clerk’s work to
performing research; preparing bench memos; and editing, cite-checking, and
commenting on the judge’s drafts. Some assign the writing of the first draft to
a law clerk in routine cases only; others have clerks write first drafts in
even the most complex cases, having found that working from a draft makes the
task of writing the opinion easier. A clerk assigned to write the first draft
should use an outline developed by or with the judge, and should understand the
scope, organization, and probable outcome of the opinion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:18.3pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Many judges, having found that it takes more time to work
with a clerk’s draft, write their own draft, then polish it into the final
product. Some judges invite the law clerk to rewrite the judge’s first draft
before the judge returns to it for preparation of the final version. Work-</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;

style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:107%'>10</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>ing with electronic documents
facilitates this give-and-take between judges and law clerks in drafting
opinions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The process the judge uses depends on his or her own work
habits and style and on the capabilities of the law clerk. The judge must
always remember, however, that the law clerk usually is fresh out of law school
and has little practical experience. Even a distinguished academic record does
not qualify a law clerk to practice the craft of judging, to draw the fine line
between reversible and harmless error, to make the sometimes delicate
assessment of the effect of precedent, or to recognize subtle distinctions in
the applicable law. It is the unusual law clerk who has perfected a writing
style that makes for a satisfactory opinion. Law clerks’ fact statements,
analysis, and conclusions may require major revisions. Judges should not simply
edit draft opinions. No matter how capable the clerk, the opinion must always
be the judge’s work. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29918">Reviewing materials </a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Little need be said about the
materials to review. The judge will, of course, have the briefs of the parties
and the law clerk’s bench memorandum. When an opinion turns on the specifics of
testimony or on what occurred in the courtroom, there may be no substitute for
reading the relevant portions of the transcript; rarely will excerpts or
summaries in briefs convey the significance of these events fairly and fully.
If an exhibit is crucial, it should be examined. Reference to the record may
also be necessary to determine the precise procedural course by which an appeal
has reached the court and the relevant proceedings below. The judge will
therefore want to have access to the record while preparing the opinion.
Listening to an audio recording of oral argument, if one is available, can help
refresh the judge’s memory of the significant issues and the arguments made. </p>

necessary instructions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The organization and style of
opinions will, of course, vary from case to case, but this is the framework on
which to build. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Clear and logical organization
of the opinion will help the reader understand it. The use of headings and
subheadings or Roman numerals, or other means of disclosing the organization to
the reader, is always helpful, particularly when the opinion is long and the
subject matter complex. Headings, subheadings, and subdivisions not only
provide road signs for the reader, they also help the writer organize his or
her thoughts and test the logic of the opinion. They also enable a judge who
wishes not to join some part of the opinion to identify it. And they assist in
the indexing and classification of opinions and their retrieval by researchers.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:11.65pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-align:left;text-indent:0in'>   The
following sections discuss each of the elements of an opinion. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29921">Introduction </a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The purpose of the Introduction
is to orient the reader to the case. It should state briefly what the case is
about, the legal subject matter, and the result. It may also cover some or all
of the following: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:31.0pt;text-indent:-13.0pt'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>The parties:</i>
The parties should be identified, if not in the Introduction, then early in the
opinion, preferably by name, and names should be used consistently throughout.
(The use of legal descriptions, such as “appellant” and “appellee,” tends to be
confusing, especially in multi-party cases.)</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:31.0pt;text-indent:-13.0pt'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>The procedural and
jurisdictional status:</i> The basis for jurisdiction, relevant prior
proceedings, and how the case got before the court should be outlined.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:31.0pt;text-indent:-13.0pt'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>The issue:</i> The
issue or issues to be decided should be identified, unless they are so complex
that they are better treated in a separate section. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Summarizing the holding at the
outset can save time for readers, particularly researchers who will be able to
determine immediately whether to read the rest of the opinion. Providing a
terse summary of the holding at the start of the opinion also helps the judge
state it precisely and succinctly. The final version of the Introduction may be
best written after the opinion is completed, when the judge has refined the
issues, the conclusions, and the supporting analysis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:-.7pt;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-align:left;text-indent:0in;
line-height:102%'>            Some judges prefer to place the holding at the
end, believing that an opinion will be more persuasive if the reader must read
through it before learning the outcome. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29922">Statement of issues </a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The statement of issues is the
cornerstone of the opinion; how the issues are formulated determines which
facts are material and what legal principles govern. Judges should not be bound
by the attorneys’ analyses; they should state the issues as they see them, even
if this differs from how the lawyers state them. That an issue has been raised
by the parties does not mean that it must be addressed in the opinion if it is
not material to the outcome of the case. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> The statement of issues should
be brief. Although an issue or two can often be sufficiently identified in the
Introduction, the number or complexity of the issues in some cases may require
separate sections.  The statement of issues may come before or after the
statement of facts. Stating the issues first will make the fact statement more
meaningful to the reader and help focus on material facts. In some cases,
however, it may be difficult to state the issues clearly unless the reader is
familiar with the material facts. This may be true, for example, when the issue
is procedural and requires an explanation of the context. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The statement of issues should not be confused with
recitals of the parties’ contentions. Lengthy statements of the parties’
contentions, occasionally found in opinions, are not a substitute for analysis
and reasoning, and they should be avoided. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29923">Statement of facts </a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>In a single-issue case, the facts
can be set forth in one statement early in the opinion. But when a case raises
a series of issues, some facts may not be relevant to all of the issues. This
situation confronts the judge with the difficult task of presenting enough
facts at the outset to make the opinion understandable without later repeating
facts when discussing particular issues that require further elaboration. In
such a case, the initial statement of facts can be limited to necessary
historical background, and the specific decisional facts can be incorporated in
the analysis of the issues they concern. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Only the facts that are
necessary to explain the decision should be included, but what is necessary to
explain the decision is not always obvious and may also vary depending on the
audience. An unpublished memorandum opinion intended only for the parties does
not require background or historical facts; the opinion need only identify the
facts that support the conclusion. However, background facts may sometimes be
helpful in giving the context of a decision and explaining its rationale. And
opinions that are likely to be read by audiences other than the parties may
require lengthier fact statements to provide the context for the decision and
delineate its scope. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Excessive factual detail can be
distracting. Dates, for example, tend to confuse readers and should not be
included unless they are material to the decision or helpful to its
understanding. Although brevity and simplicity are always desirable, they are
secondary to the need for a full and fair fact statement. Facts significant to
the losing side should not be omitted. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Some judges like to include
facts that, although not material to the decision, add color. “We’ve got to
have some fun,” one judge said. Some feel that this is a mark of the author’s
flair and improves readability. There is the obvious danger, however, that the
reader may think the decision is based on these facts even though they are not
material. Moreover, colorful writing—though appealing to the author—may be seen
by the parties as trivializing the case. It must therefore be used with
caution. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Above all, the statement of facts must be accurate. The
judge should not assume that the facts recited in the parties’ briefs are
stated correctly. There is no substitute for checking fact references against
the record. No matter how good the lawyers are, the judge may find that the way
facts are stated in the record differs from the way they are stated in the
briefs. If time does not permit the judge to read the entire record, a law
clerk should be assigned that task, with instructions to mark all the relevant
parts for the judge to review. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29924">Discussion of legal
principles </a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The discussion of legal
principles is the heart of the opinion. It must demonstrate that the court’s
conclusion is based on reason and logic. It should convince the reader of the
correctness of the decision by the power of its reasoning, not by advocacy or
argument. The judge must deal with arguably contrary authorities and opposing
arguments, and must confront the issues squarely and deal with them
forthrightly. Although the opinion need not address every case and contention,
the discussion of legal principles must be sufficient to demonstrate to the
losing party that the court has fully considered the essentials of its
position. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=left style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;
margin-bottom:7.65pt;margin-left:-.75pt;text-align:left;text-indent:0in'>  The
following guidelines apply to the discussion of legal principles. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29925">Standard of review </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>The opinion should specify the
controlling standard of review at the outset of the discussion of legal
principles. Unless the reader is told whether review is under the de novo, the
clearly erroneous, or the abuse of discretion standard, the meaning of the
decision may be obscure. Moreover, specifying the standard of review helps the
judge discipline the analysis. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Appendix C provides examples of clearly stated standards
of review. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29926">Order of discussion of
issues</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Just as the judge should not be wedded to counsel’s
formulation of the issues, he or she should not feel compelled to address the
issues in the order in which counsel presented them. The order in which to
address the issues will be dictated by the organization of the opinion.
Generally, dispositive issues should be discussed first. The order in which
those issues are taken up will be governed by the opinion’s reasoning. If
non-dispositive issues are addressed at all—for educational reasons or to guide
further proceedings—the judge should discuss them near the end of the opinion. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29927">Issues to address </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>As a general proposition, an
opinion should address only the issues that need to be resolved to decide the
case. If the court determines that an issue not raised by the parties is
dispositive and should be addressed—even though the parties have not properly
preserved and presented it—the court should notify counsel and provide them
with the opportunity to brief it. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Issues not necessary to the decision but seriously raised
by the losing party should be discussed only to the extent necessary to show
that they have been considered. The line between what is necessary to the
decision and what is not, however, is not always clear. Occasionally, a full
explanation of the rationale for a decision may be enhanced by discussion of
matters not strictly a part of the holding. Moreover, a judge may find it
efficient to address issues not necessary to the decision if the judge can
thereby provide useful guidance for the lower court on remand. However, judges
must be careful not to decide issues that are not before them and to avoid
advisory opinions and unnecessary expressions of views that may tie the court’s
hands in a future case. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29928">Alternative holdings </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.8pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Stating separate and independent grounds for a decision
adds strength to the decision but diminishes its value as a precedent.
Professor Bernard Witkin argues that judges should avoid such rulings.<a
href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
line-height:104%'><sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%;
font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;color:#181717'>[8]</span></sup></span></sup></a>
Statements such as “even if the facts were otherwise” or “assuming arguendo
that we had not concluded thus and so” undermine the authority of the holding.
Witkin suggests either limiting the “even if” approach to opinions where doing
so is necessary to achieve a majority decision or avoiding it completely by
phrasing the opinion in such a manner that the alternative ground is disposed
of first and the substantial ground of the opinion is stated last. But in
opinions that are likely to have little impact as precedent, there is no reason
why the court should not base its decision on alternative grounds, without
giving one precedence over the other. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29929">Case citations </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Most points of law are adequately
supported by citation of the latest decision on point in the court’s circuit or
the watershed case, if there is one. String citations and dissertations on the
history of the legal principle add nothing when the matter is settled in the
circuit. Judges should resist the temptation of trying to impress people with
their (or their law clerks’) erudition.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> If there is no authority in the circuit, it is appropriate
to cite authority on point from other circuits. If an opinion breaks new
ground, however, the judge should marshal existing authority and analyze the
evolution of the law sufficiently to support the new rule. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29930">Secondary sources </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Because law review articles, treatises and texts, and
non-legal sources are not primary authorities, they should be cited sparingly
and only to serve a purpose. That purpose may be to refer to a sound analysis
that supports the reasoning of the opinion. Some authors are so well respected
in their fields that, in the absence of a case on point, their word is
persuasive. Occasionally, public documents or other published works will shed
light on relevant historical or policy considerations. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29931">Quotations </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>If something important to the
opinion has been said well in an earlier case, quoting relevant language from
the case can be more persuasive and informative than merely citing or
paraphrasing it. The impact of a quote, however, is inversely proportional to
its length. Judges should quote briefly, and only when the language makes an
important point.  While quotes should be short, they must also be fair. They
must be used in context and accurately reflect the tenor of their source. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29932">Avoiding advocacy </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Justifying a decision will
sometimes require explaining why contrary arguments were rejected. In
addressing the main contentions of the losing side, however, an opinion should
not become an argument between the judge and the lawyers, other judges on the
court, or the court below. If the losing side has raised substantial
contentions, the opinion should explain why they were rejected. But the opinion
need not refute the losing party’s arguments point by point or adopt a
contentious or adversarial tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> An opinion can—and properly should—carry conviction
without becoming a tract. Judges should put aside emotion and personal
feelings, and avoid using adjectives and adverbs unless they convey information
material to the decision. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29933">Treatment of the court below
</a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Appellate opinions can and should correct trial court
errors and provide guidance on remand, but they need not attack a trial court’s
wisdom or judgment, or even its attitude in order to reverse its decision.
Moreover, an appellate opinion should avoid unnecessary criticism of the trial
court, such as for failing to consider authority or resting on improper
motives. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29934">Disposition and instructions
</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Disposition of a case—and the
mandate to the lower court or agency, when that is a part of the disposition—is
the most important part of the concluding paragraph. Appellate courts should
not speak in riddles. Simply to remand a case “for further proceedings
consistent with the opinion” may leave the court below at sea. Opinions must
spell out clearly what the lower courts or agencies are expected to do, without
trespassing on what remains entrusted to their discretion. Thus, even if an
abuse of discretion is found, the appellate court’s decision is on the law, and
the lower court or agency on remand retains the authority to exercise its
discretion properly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Appendix D contains examples of
dispositions that provide clear instructions to the lower court or agency. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Summary disposition may be appropriate
in cases in which only the parties and their lawyers are interested in the
result, the facts are not complex, and the precedents are clear. It may take
the form of a one-sentence order or a brief memorandum (see Appendix B). The
court should state its reason for making a summary disposition. When a summary
disposition is pursuant to circuit or local rule, that rule should be cited. <br

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29936">Problems in judicial writing
</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The judges who were interviewed for this manual identified
the following as the major problems in judicial writing: wordiness, lack of
precision and clarity, poor organization, cryptic analysis, and pomposity and
humor. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29937">Wordiness </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Wordiness means not just using two words when one will do,
but trying to convey too much information and covering too many issues. In
trying to write authoritatively, some judges belabor the obvious in lengthy
discussions of uncontroversial propositions. Often wordiness reflects the
writer’s failure (or inability) to separate the material from the immaterial
and do the tedious work of editing. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29938">Lack of precision and
clarity </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Precision and clarity are the
main concerns of good writing. Some legal writers lack the ability to write simple,
straightforward prose. Often this is the result of some lawyers’ tendency to
overgeneralize when they are not sure of a legal principle or of how to state
it precisely; they finesse the difficulty with vague expression. To write with
clarity and precision, the writer must know exactly what he or she wants to say
and must say that and nothing else. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Precision in judicial writing is
important because judges write for posterity. Once an opinion is filed, lawyers
and others will read it with an eye to how they can use it to serve their
particular purpose, no matter how different that may be from what the judge had
in mind. Thus, it is important for judicial writers to think about how their
words might be used and to write in a manner that will forestall their misuse. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Painstaking and thoughtful editing is essential for
precise writing. This means going over the opinion, sentence by sentence, and
asking: What do I mean to say here, and have I said it and no more? </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29939">Poor organization </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Another problem in judicial writing is poor organization. A
sound opinion is the reflection of a logical process of reasoning from premises
through principles to conclusions. The framework in which that process takes
place should be visible to the reader from the organization of the opinion.
That organization will be a road map that enables the reader to follow the
reasoning from the beginning to the end without getting lost. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29940">Cryptic analysis </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>While brevity is desirable in an opinion, judges must
elaborate their reasoning sufficiently so that the reader can follow it. An
opinion that omits steps in the reasoning essential to understanding it will
fail to serve its purposes. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29941">Pomposity and humor </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Judicial writing can be pompous. The judge must avoid
pompous writing in an opinion, such as arcane or florid language, use of the
imperial “we” (by a single district judge), or expressions of irrelevant
erudition. Although the use of humor is sometimes rationalized as an antidote
to pomposity, it works better in after-dinner speeches than in judicial
opinions. In the latter, it may strike the litigants—who are not likely to see
anything funny in the litigation—as a sign of judicial arrogance and lack of
sensitivity. Although some judges seem to have succeeded in using humor in
their opinions, it is a risk not to be taken lightly. Nor need it be taken at
all, for writing can be made lively, forceful, and interesting by its clarity
and logic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The following guidelines are suggested to help writers of
opinions recognize and avoid the problems discussed above: eliminate
unnecessary words, be succinct and direct, and use plain English.</p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29943">Eliminate unnecessary words </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.75pt;

words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing
should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This
requires not that the writer make all sentences short, or avoid all detail and
treat subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.</span><a href="#_ftn9"

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29944">Be succinct and direct </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Brevity promotes clarity. Writing
that makes its point briefly is more likely to be understood than writing that
is lengthy. Writing succinctly also forces the writer to think clearly and
focus on what he or she is trying to say. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Judicial writing should be direct. Judicial writers should
use simple, declarative sentences and short paragraphs most of the time, but
vary sentence length and structure where necessary for emphasis or contrast.
They should also use the active voice and avoid such constructions as “it is
said,” “it is argued,” and “it is well founded.” They should weed out
gratuitous adjectives and eliminate unnecessary adverbs such as “clearly,”
“plainly,” and “merely.” </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29945">Use plain English </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>Even complex ideas can be expressed in simple language that
the lay reader can understand. To express an idea in simple language requires
that the writer understand the idea fully, enabling him or her to break it down
into its essential components. For example, although electricity is a complex
scientific phenomenon, it can be explained in terms laypersons understand. So
can tax, antitrust, and patent law. Judges should avoid using clichés,
hackneyed phrases (“as hereinabove set forth,” for example), Latin expressions
(“vel non,” for example), and legal jargon. When using terms of art, judges
should consider whether they are commonly understood by their audience or
require plain English definitions. There is a place for the elegant word, but
it should not be necessary for the reader to have a dictionary at hand while
reading an opinion. As legal writing expert Bryan Garner has written:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.3in;margin-bottom:16.15pt;
margin-left:22.8pt;line-height:105%'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:

As often as not they are scars left by the law’s verbal elephantiasis, which
only lately has started into remission. Use words and phrases that you know to
be both precise and as widely understood as possible. Rarely can you justify
the little-known word on grounds that it is a term of art.</span><a

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:9.1pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The purpose of a footnote is to convey information that
would disrupt the flow of the opinion if included in the text. The first
question a judge should ask about a prospective footnote is whether its content
is appropriate for inclusion in the opinion. If it is not important enough to
go into the text, the judge must have some justification for including it in
the opinion at all. The use of footnotes can be appropriate to convey
information that supports the language of the opinion but is not necessary to
understand it, such as the text of a statute or material from the record.
Footnotes can also be used to acknowledge and briefly dispose of tangential
issues. Some judges place all citations in footnotes, leaving the text entirely
for discussion. But footnotes should not be used simply as a repository for
information that the judge wants to keep but does not know what to do with.
Some judges, conscious of the tendency to overuse footnotes, have strived to
eliminate or at least reduce the number of footnotes in their opinions.<a

citation forms, however, is not a productive use of judges’ or law clerks’
time. The purpose of citations is to assist researchers in identifying and
finding the sources; a form of citation that will serve that end is sufficient.
Whatever form of citation is used, it should be used consistently to avoid
confusion and the appearance of lack of craftsmanship and care. Some judges
maintain personal citation forms or style manuals that reflect their
preferences. Such forms and manuals promote consistency, help orient new
clerks, and encourage careful preparation of opinions. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29949">Careful editing </a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Careful writers edit their work
critically to clarify the ambiguities, eliminate the superfluous, smooth the
transitions, and tighten the structure. This is not an easy task, because when
reading their own writing, writers tend to read what they meant to write rather
than what they actually wrote. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Judges must strive to be
objective about their writing, to read every paragraph carefully, and not to
skip over text because it is familiar. A judge who is editing his or her own
work must always ask these questions: Have I said precisely what I intended to
say? Is there a better way to say it? Does the thought flow clearly and
logically? Will the reader understand it? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> The following techniques should help judicial writers
improve their editing skills. </p>

<h3 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29950">Reread and revise </a></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Editing an opinion involves
striking needless words and unnecessary facts, rewriting unclear sentences,
eliminating repetition, reorganizing, and making the opinion cleaner and
sharper. “I spend a lot of time editing, clearing away my own and the clerks’
underbrush,” one judge said. “The underbrush may be valuable someplace or
sometime, but not here and now.” This process may take the judge through many
drafts before a polished opinion emerges. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Electronic word processing
software is a boon to writers and editors. It greatly speeds up the writing
process and facilitates editing and revising. But proofreading text on a
computer screen is demanding, and without careful and repeated checking of a
printed copy, typographical and other errors can be easily missed, even if
automated spelling and grammar features are used. </p>

margin-left:-.25pt'>In some circuits, the complexity and number of issues
involved in a single case have resulted in jointly written opinions. Sometimes
the opinion is designated as per curiam; at other times the authors of the
different sections are identified. The review of long and technical
administrative records in the D.C. Circuit, for example, has resulted in joint
opinions.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><sup><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:104%'><sup><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> When a panel chooses to issue a
joint opinion, considerable planning and coordination by both judges and law
clerks are necessary to ensure a readable and coherent final opinion. It is
desirable for the judges to hold a longer-than-usual post-argument conference
to discuss the assignment of opinion sections, their interdependence, and joint
assumptions or factual predicates. The panel may need to determine the sequence
of sections to avoid confusion and repetition of basic facts or legal analyses.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Generally, one judge on the
panel must assume coordinating authority and circulate an outline and summary
of the proposed sections before writing begins. One judge, usually the
coordinating judge, must also take responsibility for writing the Introduction
and Conclusion, which cover all sections. The Introduction is usually brief and
confined to a statement of the proceedings leading to the court challenge. The
facts in detail are better presented as needed in the individual sections. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> After the authors have drafted and approved the various
sections, the coordinating judge should assume authority to make
non-substantive changes to the draft to eliminate duplication or gross
stylistic differences. The law clerks usually meet to decide on a uniform
citation and heading format. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29955">Commenting on a draft
prepared by another judge </a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Judges circulate draft opinions
to other judges on a panel or en banc court to ensure that the opinion reflects
the rationale of the judges in the majority. When commenting on an opinion
written by another judge, it is always appropriate to comment on the opinion’s
substance, but inappropriate to comment on matters of style. When the distinction
between substance and style is fuzzy, judges’ comments are appropriate if the
matter in question seems to speak for the court and thus might send a message
that does not represent the view of the other judges. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:11.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> If, for example, the discussion of a substantive issue is
not written clearly, the other judges should bring this to the attention of the
writing judge. When a citation to a case or law review article may represent a
rationale that is not adopted by other judges, they should express their disagreement
to the writing judge. When, however, a reviewing judge objects to stylistic,
grammatical, or language choices simply on the basis of personal preference,
such objections are best left unexpressed. Nevertheless, although judges are
not grading the work of their colleagues, it is helpful to point out minor
matters, such as typographical errors, either by a note to the author or by a
telephone call between law clerks. </p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29956">Dissenting opinions </a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Dissenting opinions can serve
useful functions in communicating important information to an opinion’s
audiences and furthering the growth of the law. They may help to encourage en
banc or certiorari review and to isolate and refine the issues for further
appeal. They may promote legislative action to correct possible shortcomings in
the law. Dissenting opinions may also help to narrow the scope of a decision by
pointing out the possible dangers of the position the majority has taken or by
indicating to other judges and the bar the limits of a particular decision and
its effect on similar cases in the future.  Dissenting opinions are written at
a potential cost, however. A dissent that sounds strident or preachy may
contribute to divisiveness and ill feelings in the court, may undermine the
authority of the majority opinion and of the court as an institution, and may
create confusion. Whether judges should dissent depends on the nature of the
case and the principle at issue. Judges generally should not write dissenting
opinions when the principle at issue is settled and the decision has little
significance outside the specific case. Cases that involve emerging legal
principles or statutory interpretation in areas that will affect future
activities of the bar, the public, and the government are more likely to
warrant dissenting opinions than cases of limited application. The issue should
be significant enough that the judge’s “fever is aroused,” as one judge said,
but the motivation for writing a dissent should be to further the development
of the law rather than to vent personal feelings. Judges considering whether to
dissent should ask themselves whether the likely benefits outweigh the
potential costs.  If a judge decides that writing a dissent will serve a useful
purpose, the judge should write it as carefully and responsibly as an opinion
of the court. Rarely should a judge dissent without an opinion; doing so
communicates no information to the opinion’s readers. The dissenting opinion
should focus on the critical principles and distinguish the dissenter’s
rationale from that of the majority. The dissenting judge should state the
points of disagreement forcefully and effectively without engaging in argument
or advocacy. A dissenting opinion should not simply slash at the majority
opinion or its author. Personal attacks, offensive language, or a condescending
tone should not be used, although some judges believe that expressing moral
outrage and restrained indignation may sometimes be appropriate. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Appendix E contains examples of
brief dissenting opinions that reflect a temperate, reasoned tone in expressing
sincere disagreement with the majority.</p>

<h2 style='margin-left:-.25pt'><a name="_Toc29957">Concurring opinions</a></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>Most of the considerations
applicable to dissenting opinions also apply to concurrences. Concurring
opinions are appropriate where they are intended to define with greater
precision the scope of the majority opinion or otherwise inform the parties and
other audiences of what the writer believes are important points. Thus, judges
may issue concurrences when there are two argued grounds for a decision, the majority
justifies its decision on one of those grounds, and other judges believe the
alternative ground should be stated. Concurrences may also serve to indicate to
parties in future cases how far the court is willing to go down a particular
road. A judge should not write a concurring opinion simply to add a point of
view or personal statement that does not further either the decisional or
educational value of the majority opinion. In deciding whether to write a
concurring opinion, the judge should ask the question: Am I writing this for
myself or for the good of the court? </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Judges should include in their
concurring opinions a statement of reasons why they are concurring. The point
is not to present an alternative opinion of the court, but to indicate the point
of departure from the majority and to further define the contours of the
majority opinion. Concurrences should also not rehash the facts and legal
principles on which the majority based its decision, unless the judge has
interpreted the facts and principles in a different way. The arguments should
be principled, and the tone should be instructive but not pedantic. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Appendix F contains examples of
useful and narrowly written concurring opinions. </p>

<h1 style='margin-right:.05pt'><a name="_Toc29958">VII. Reading About Writing </a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'>One of the judges we interviewed

considered by many authorities to be the leading guide on writing style. A copy
of it should be in every chambers. Many judges and legal writing experts
consider Bryan Garner to be the preeminent authority on legal writing style. He

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Some judges find that reading
old opinions helps them to improve the clarity of their writing. “Sometimes
I’ll remember an opinion that I think was particularly good in terms of
teaching the legal principles,” one judge said. “The old opinion will become
sort of a textbook for how to skin that cat.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:2.75pt;

application to the law and the more you can stay away from legal jargon or the
same tired old words. I find that reading outside of the law, sometimes a
phrase will stick in your mind, sometimes a word, sometimes an image.
Analogizing to non-legal situations can liven up your writing, as can introducing
unexpected words and images. </span></p>

Memorandum Opinion </a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.65pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The following excerpt is an example of a memorandum
opinion. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> This is a consolidated appeal
from two actions . . . . Defendants . . . appeal from final judgments of
foreclosure and sale entered in the [district court] dated . . . and . . . . We
need not recite the facts of this case, since they are set forth in detail in
the district court’s two thorough opinions, reported at . . . . Familiarity
with these facts is assumed. See also [related action]. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> The principal argument of
[defendants] on appeal is this: The district court erred in dismissing the
“faithless agent” defense to foreclosure under [state] law. That defense is an
attempt to avoid the established rule of agency law that a principal is liable
to third parties for the acts of an agent operating within the scope of the
agent’s real or apparent authority. <i>See British American &amp; Eastern Co.
v. Wirth Ltd.,</i> 592 F.2d 75, 80 (2d Cir. 1979). Appellants . . . do not
contest that appellee . . ., the mortgagee of the properties involved here, was
a third party. Nor do they deny that [appellee] was dealing with their agent
[land company] and that the latter was acting within the scope of its apparent
authority. Nevertheless, they invoke the faithless agent defense, claiming that
[appellee] should be barred from foreclosing because it was aware of the
mismanagement of B . . ., who was acting as president of [the land company]. To
support this view, they point to evidence that [appellee] believed that B’s
mismanagement was the root cause of the default. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> We are not persuaded that the
district court erred in rejecting the faithless agent defense. Assuming
arguendo that this defense may be invoked under the right circumstances, we
considered and rejected it in [citation]. Indeed, the party asserting the
faithless agent defense in [citation] appears to have been essentially the
same, in all but name, as [defendants]. [Citation.] Moreover, even if, as
defendants contend, principles of collateral estoppel do not bar their claim,
we find the reasoning of the [citation] panel dispositive on this record. “It
cannot be that a mortgagee’s awareness of defaults under a mortgage constitutes
awareness that a managing agent is engaged in self-dealing.” [Citation.] On the
record before us, “[f]aced with only conclusory allegations and unsupported
factual assertions,” we reject, as did the [citation] panel, the “‘faithless
agent’ defense.” [Citation.]    The judgments of the district court are
affirmed. <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>

in respect to VOC cleanup; it will amend that order to require [defendant] to
clean up VOCs in the soil at the . . . site to a level that it determines
“public health” and the “public interest” require. (2) The court will
reconsider the matter of “indirect costs,” explaining, as we have set forth
above, any denial of those costs as a sanction. In all other respects the
judgment of the district court is affirmed. </p>

<h1 style='margin-right:.05pt'><a name="_Toc29965">Appendix E: Sample Brief
Dissenting Opinions </a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.65pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The following are examples of brief dissenting opinions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> The reasons why I am constrained
to dissent may be briefly stated.  The question whether an anti-takeover
provision provides a “special protection” to debenture holders cannot be
answered in the negative merely because the “Independent Directors” decided to
waive their provisions and approve a particular transaction. These directors
were explicitly empowered to act in this fashion by virtue of the fully
disclosed terms of the provision. A significant function of an anti-takeover
provision is to serve as a deterrent to hostile takeovers, including takeovers
which would be contrary to the interests of both shareholders and debenture
holders. One cannot, I believe, fairly characterize such a provision as being
“worthless” to the debenture holders, even though as a matter of Delaware law
directors owe a fiduciary duty solely to shareholders. The anti-takeover
provision was therefore a “special protection” to debenture holders, albeit a
limited one. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Federal securities laws do not
impose an obligation to advise investors of the fundamentals of corporate
governance. The disclosure required by the federal securities laws is not a
“rite of confession or exercise in common law pleading. What is required is the
disclosure of material objective factual matters.” <i>Data Probe Acquisition
Corp. v. Data Lab, Inc.,</i> 722 F.2d 1, 5–6 (2d Cir. 1983), <i>cert. denied,</i>
465 U.S. 1052, 104 S. Ct. 1326, 79 L. Ed. 722 (1984). Especially is this so
where, as here, the investor complainants are sophisticated financial
institutions making major investments. The role of the federal securities laws
is not to remedy all perceived injustices in securities transactions. Rather,
as invoked in this case, it proscribes only the making of false and misleading
statements or material omissions. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Whether the Independent
Directors breached an implied duty of good faith or otherwise acted contrary to
their fiduciary obligations are matters of state law. Here, the federal claims
were asserted only conditionally, the express condition being the failure of
the state law claims. These state claims were properly dismissed by the court
below for lack of pendent jurisdiction. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> Believing no valid federal claim
to be present, I would affirm essentially for the reasons set forth in the
Opinions of the Magistrate and District Court. </p>

<h4 align=center style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.05pt;margin-bottom:0in;
margin-left:.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'><span
style='font-weight:normal'>* * *</span></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> In many respects this case
represents good police work. It is clear, however, that defendants were of
abnormally low intelligence and that <i>Miranda</i> warnings were not given.
Even though appellants had not been taken in custody, it is also true they had
not been furnished counsel or waived same. As the district court held, the
government agents should have taken further precautions to ensure that
[defendants] understood the situation and their rights. <i>See Henry v. Dees,</i>
658 F.2d 406, 411 (5th Cir. 1981).<br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
</p>

<h1 style='margin-right:.05pt'><a name="_Toc29966">Appendix F: Sample Brief
Concurring Opinions</a></h1>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:12.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'>The following are examples of brief, narrowly written
concurring opinions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> I concur with most of Judge
_____’s thoughtful discussion of the issues in this case. I am fully in accord
with Part IIA and C and the rationale with respect to the claims against
[defendant] and the state law claims. I agree also with the statement in Part
IIB that “[d]ue process concerns are clearly not implicated in [defendants’]
actions with regard to the letter from . . . .” I agree further that there is
“no support . . . for plaintiff’s fanciful conspiracy theory.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> I find no necessity, however, to
adopt the statement quoted from <i>Rice v. Ohio Department of Transportation,</i>
887 F.2d 716, 719 (6th Cir. 1989), which may be interpreted to mean that the
doctrine of <i>Will v. Michigan Department of State Police,</i> 491 U.S. 58
(1989), somehow bars suits under § 1983 against state officials when those
officials are being sued in their individual capacities. I do not view <i>Will</i>
as barring § 1983 suits against state officials whenever the suits concern
actions taken in their individual capacities. Instead, I believe that <i>Will</i>
bars suits against state officials only when those officials are sued in their
official capacities. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:5.75pt;
margin-left:-.25pt'> Accordingly, I would affirm the decision of the district
court that under the facts of this case defendants . . . enjoy qualified
immunity. </p>

margin-left:.5pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-align:center'><span
style='font-weight:normal'>* * *</span></h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:-.25pt'> I concur with the results
reached by Judge _____ and in his opinion except as to his analysis of the
First Amendment issue. For the reasons stated in my concurring opinion in
[citation], I believe the . . . regulations are permissible time, place, and
manner restrictions on speech in the [plaintiff’s] profession.</p>

The Education Division plans and produces education and training programs for
judges and court staff, including video programs, publications, curriculum
packages for in-court training, and Web-based programs and resources. The
Research Division examines and evaluates current and alternative federal court
practices and policies. This research assists Judicial Conference committees,
who request most Center research, in developing policy recommendations. The
Center’s research also contributes substantially to its educational programs.
The two divisions work closely with two units of the Director’s Office—the
Information Technology Office and the Communications Policy &amp; Design
Office—in using print, broadcast, and on-line media to deliver education and
training and to disseminate the results of Center research. The Federal Judicial
History Office helps courts and others study and preserve federal judicial
history. The International Judicial Relations Office provides information to
judicial and legal officials from foreign countries and assesses how to inform
federal judicial personnel of developments in international law and other court
systems that may affect their work. </span></p>
